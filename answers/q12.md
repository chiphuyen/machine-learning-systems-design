# Answer to question 12

**Question 12**

How would you design an algorithm to match pool riders for Lyft or Uber?

**Answer**

There are several factors that need to be considered in order to create an efficient algorithm.

One important factor is the pickup location of each rider. The algorithm needs to take into account the proximity of each rider to one another and to the driver, as well as any traffic or road conditions that may impact travel time. It's also important to consider the timing of each rider's pickup, as some may be more time-sensitive than others.

Another important factor is the number of riders in each pool. The algorithm needs to balance the desire for maximum cost savings for riders with the practicality of fitting multiple people in a single vehicle. It's also important to consider the preferences of each rider, such as their willingness to share a ride with strangers or their desire for a more private ride.

Additionally, the algorithm needs to account for any special needs or requests from riders, such as wheelchair accessibility or the need for a car seat. These factors can impact the type of vehicle needed and the routing of the ride.
