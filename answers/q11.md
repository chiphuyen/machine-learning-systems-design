# Answer to question 11

**Question 11**

When you type a question on StackOverflow, you're shown a list of similar questions to make sure that your question hasn't been asked before. How do you build such a system?

**Answer**

Building a system used in Stackoverflow is a complex task that involves several steps. Here's a brief overview of how such a system can be built:

* **Data Collection:** The first step in building a system like this is to collect data. StackOverflow already has a vast database of questions, so this data can be used to train the system. Additionally, web scraping can be used to collect data from other sources, such as GitHub or Reddit.

* **Data Cleaning:** Once the data is collected, it needs to be cleaned and preprocessed. This involves removing any irrelevant information and converting the text into a format that the system can understand. For example, this might involve converting text to lowercase, removing stop words, and stemming or lemmatizing the words.

* **Feature Extraction:** The next step is to extract features from the cleaned data. These features are used to represent the questions in a way that the system can understand. Some common features include bag-of-words, TF-IDF, and word embeddings.

* **Similarity Calculation:** Once the features are extracted, the system needs to calculate the similarity between the user's question and the questions in the database. This is typically done using a similarity metric such as cosine similarity.

* **Ranking:** Once the system has calculated the similarity between the user's question and the questions in the database, it needs to rank the results and display the most relevant questions to the user. This ranking can be based on a variety of factors, such as the similarity score, the popularity of the question, or the age of the question.
