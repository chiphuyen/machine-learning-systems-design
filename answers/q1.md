# Answer to question 1

**Question 1**

Duolingo is a platform for language learning. When a student is learning a new language, Duolingo wants to recommend increasingly difficult stories to read.
	- How would you measure the difficulty level of a story?
	- Given a story, how would you edit it to make it easier or more difficult?

**Answer**

There are several techniques used for analyzing the difficulty for text, such as :

1. **Readability scores:** Readability scores measure the complexity of text based on factors such as sentence length, word frequency, and vocabulary. The higher the score, the more difficult the text is to read.
2. **Syntactic complexity:** This technique looks at the complexity of the sentence structures in the text. More complex sentence structures tend to make the text more difficult to read.
3. **Readability scores:** Various readability scores exist that can be used to measure the difficulty level of a story. For example, the Flesch-Kincaid grade level score calculates the average number of words per sentence and syllables per word to determine the grade level at which the text can be understood.

To edit a story to make it easier or more difficult, here are some ways:

* One approach is to simplify or replace complex words with simpler synonyms. This is done by analyzing the frequency of words in the story and identifying uncommon or difficult words. The program can then suggest synonyms to make the text easier to understand.

* Another technique is to shorten or simplify sentences. The program can use syntactic complexity analysis to identify complex sentence structures and suggest simpler ways to convey the same information. This can help to improve the overall readability of the text.
