# Answer to question 10

**Question 10**

Autocompletion: how would you build an algorithm to finish your sentence when you text?

**Answer**

One approach is to use statistical language models, such as n-gram models, to predict the next word in a sentence based on the previous words. The model can be trained on a large corpus of text data to learn the likelihood of word sequences and use that knowledge to suggest the most probable word to complete a sentence.

Another approach is to use neural language models, such as the Transformer architecture, which can capture the context of a sentence more effectively by considering the entire sentence as a whole rather than just the preceding words.
